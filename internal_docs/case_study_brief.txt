CASE STUDY BRIEF: AI SCREENING SYSTEM

OBJECTIVE:
Build a backend service that automates initial screening of job applications.

REQUIREMENTS:

1. SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE:
   - Must use FastAPI or similar backend framework
   - Implement async job processing
   - Use vector database for document retrieval
   - Integrate with LLM service (OpenAI/Gemini/OpenRouter)

2. EVALUATION PIPELINE:
   - CV Evaluation: Compare candidate CV against Job Description
   - Project Report Evaluation: Evaluate candidate's project report against this case study brief
   - Final Synthesis: Combine both evaluations into overall summary

3. API ENDPOINTS:
   - POST /upload: Accept CV and Project Report PDFs
   - POST /evaluate: Trigger evaluation pipeline
   - GET /result/{id}: Check evaluation status and results

4. TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:
   - Implement RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)
   - Use prompt engineering for consistent evaluations
   - Handle edge cases and errors gracefully
   - Provide clear documentation

EVALUATION CRITERIA:
- Correctness of implementation
- Code quality and modularity
- Error handling and resilience
- Documentation clarity
- Creativity in solution
